*Please don't bother to clone this project at this time.  It's an incomplete work-in-progress until I can pull together multiple separate component code-bases, unify and upload them for inclusion.  Then I'll update this README and delete these top lines when I have something fully functional.  Initially this will be in the form of a scene viewer/editor.*


# VulkanAddOns
Once [VulkanModule](https://github.com/electromaggot/VulkanModule) sets up Vulkan, provide features to enhance usability.  These will include, for starters, a bevy of 3D test objects, with coordinated shaders/assets, then support for 3D Models (from OBJ files, firstly), 3D Fonts (from TrueType/OpenType files), and eventually: particle system, game/graphics engine, and more.
